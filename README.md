# heart-disease-project
Developed a machine learning pipeline to predict heart disease using a publicly available dataset.

In the jupyter notebook, I used various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries to develop a predictive model that determines the likelihood of heart disease based on an individual's health characteristics.

The original data came from the Cleveland database from UCI Machine Learning Repository. This database includes 76 attributes, but all published studies relate to the use of a subset of 14 of them, so that's what I decided to use here.
This is the kaggle version that I used: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/redwankarimsony/heart-disease-data)
